    "Cell types are stereotypically organized in parallel visual columns, which retinotopically cover visual space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repetitive structure ensures the parallel processing of visual features. Each part of the visual system can extract the same infomation across visual space, including info about luminance, color contrast, edges, direction of local motion. Within these structures, the homogeneous connectivity of individual cell types is considered a common design principle of diverse visual systems. As a consequence, cells of one type are considered anatomically, genetically, and functionally uniform.\n",

    "Some evidence argues for the diverse of synaptic wiring in the fly visual system. \n",
